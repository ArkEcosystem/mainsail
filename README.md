Welcome to the home of Mainsail, a highly modular, TypeScript-based, layer 1 blockchain protocol. Mainsail is the next evolution of the 'ARK Core' blockchain protocol and features a new consensus engine that greatly improves the finality, security, and reliability of our blockchain solution.

The Mainsail of a ship is its driving force, guiding it toward its destination with strength and efficiency. It's an apt metaphor for what we envision this upgrade to be: the driving force behind our blockchain, directing our technology toward a brighter future.
